# Api Project
This is a project made using C# 10 and .NET 6, with the IDE Visual Studio Comunity Edition 2022.

:fa-check: The main project is called ApiProject which you can compile with Visual studio 2022 and run it. It is a project that calls a mock Api and gets a fictional list o employees or just an employee by Id.

:fa-search: There is a complementary project named ApiProject.Test in where there are some unit tests for the main project. As with the main project, you just have to compile it and run the tests to try it.
:fa-exclamation: Please try one test at a time commenting the others, because the API has a limit of request and you have to wait some seconds before sending a new request.
