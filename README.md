# Api Project
This is a project made using C# 10 and .NET 6, with the IDE Visual Studio Comunity Edition 2022.
To donwload you just have to have Git installed in your computer, 
then use the command git clone https://github.com/andresali1/ApiProject.git
After that, open the solution named "ApiProject.sln" with Visual Studio 2022 and you will see the entire project.

* The main project is called "ApiProject" which you can compile with Visual studio 2022 and run it. It is a project that calls a mock Api and gets a fictional list o employees or just an employee by Id.

* There is a complementary project named "ApiProject.Test" in where there are some unit tests for the main project. As with the main project, you just have to compile it and run the tests to try it.

! Please try one test at a time commenting the others, because the API has a limit of request and you have to wait some seconds before sending a new request.
